        For XGN's TestSTG

        <b>TRL English Supplement</b>
        Composed By Zzzyt\nTitle Theme\nIt's not really intended for a title theme. XGN chose it to be one.\nMaybe it's too sad to fit this role.... Who knows, it's just an experiment by myself.\nSome part of it was inspired by Unreal Superhero 3, the famous piece of keygen music.\nYou know why it's in chiptune style? Because I'm lazy to mess around with high-tech samplers (laugh)
        
        <b>TRL Chinese Supplement</b>
        作曲:Zzzyt\n标题画面曲\n本来不是标题画面曲，这是XGN强行征用的结果。\n所以某些部分可能过于抑郁了...本来就是实验品，勉强够格吧。\n部分受到了Unreal Superhero 3的启发，那毕竟是著名Keygen音乐，我莫名其妙地就写进去了。\n至于为什么是8bit风而很不合群，是因为我懒得调合成器什么的，8bit多省事啊(笑)。\n另外名字本来也不是这样。也是XGN强行征用的结果。

However, when entering this time, a feeling of existence occured you.\n\"Some supernatural power must have appeared... It's not harmful I think. I feel happy about the new things.\"As it is not for a boss, the music is very relaxed. Just like the unexpected feeling. You can "see" the part of the Void you are in,in every music.
        
        <b>TRL Chinese Supplement</b>
        Zhuky.RLG作曲\n一面道中曲\n虚空中有什么？没人知道。也许虚空就只是完全的虚无。然而，这一次踏入虚空时，一种存在的意识冲击了你的心灵\n\"超自然力量显然已经出现了...我觉得这并不有害，我甚至为了这种新鲜事物而感到愉悦！" \"既然不是boss战斗曲, 这首曲子十分轻松。就像意外的感受。你可以在音乐中“看见”虚空。

They went through a really hard time but now, the future contain every chance and every possibility! I wanted to express the sadness of the wizards, however in the end I thought as they have been saved, they should have their new fate, their future has been brightened, so I decided to make the second part of the music happy and vivid.

        It's heavily inspired by <i>D City Rock</i> by TeddyLoid. I never watched the <i>Panty&Stocking</i> anime though.
        However it's not really a remix, at least not to a degree to be listed as "source".

        <b>FL Project File Comment</b>
        Created on FL Mobile.

        Unused song in Touhou Rune Legend.

        <b>TRL English Supplement</b>
        Composed by Zzzyt\nUnused Song\nUsed to be stage 3 boss theme.\nI guess I made too many chiptunes..so I gave rock a try (maybe it's not rock...?)\nThe percussion part is really my favorite one, I tried to express courage against harsh life.\nI'm too lazy to come up with a good title.

        <b>TRL Chinese Supplement</b>
        作曲:Zzzyt\n未使用\n本来是三面boss曲。\n大概是8bit做的太多了，我现在改过自新换摇滚试一试（这究竟是不是摇滚也成问题）。\n个人尤其喜欢打击乐器的部分。可能是在表达困难生活中的某种勇气吧。\n构思合理的名字实在是一件困难的事。

        Once in a while, I thought among all the Desire Drive remixes of Zzzyt, this is the best one
        Why? It gave me a feeling of emptiness and forwardness together.
        However, after listening to it too many times in many projects, I find it nothing uncommon now. :rofl:

        A remix of Desire Drive by Team Shanghai Alice.
